I've decided not to rush into fruition because I'm a slow worker and have previously completed it.
Since I know that I had to look back at some of my previous work, I've instead taken my last 25 minutes to go through the code and write down the points that I battled on. These points are issues that I feel I should focus on before the next assessment.

1. Mapping:
  Ok on knowing how to create a map. However how to use a map to its full potential is something I struggle with. Also the concept of 'returning' and how to combine map value and keys is something I need to practice.


2. Modules:
  I know from our previous discussion that I was not calling my functions/modules properly. I'd like to learn how to do it the correct way.




3. Syntax:

  I found myself forgetting when and where to use which brackets. Also a common mistake I made often was writing variables with incorrect spelling. Also initially wrote things down backwards like split.string or ()fixed.2 instead of ()toFixed.2


4. Operators:
  I'm not confident enough to know quickly how to use operators such as +=, - etc.


5. Identification of solution:

Often felt myself thinking too long about solutions and when to use eachOf/for array/object etc.


6. Good, Side Note
  I found a silly mistake or two in my previous work that made me happy I could identify it.
  I was more at ease using github/terminal.
